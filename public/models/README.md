# 3D Models for Plug Penguin

This directory contains the 3D models used in the Plug Penguin game.

## Current Models

1. `POOKIE.glb` - The main character model

## Future Models

The following models can be added to enhance the game visuals:

- `igloo.glb` - Igloo building model (currently created with primitives)
- `tree.glb` - Tree model (currently created with primitives)
- `snowman.glb` - Snowman model (currently created with primitives)

## Model Requirements

- Models should be in .glb format
- Keep file sizes small (ideally under 1MB each) for better performance
- Models should be properly rigged if animations are needed
- Use low-poly models when possible for better performance

Until you add these models, the application will use Three.js primitives to create simple geometric shapes for these elements.
